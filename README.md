Tic-Tac-Toe Game — Project Description

Introduction

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using the C++ programming language.
It is a console-based game that allows two players to play against each other by taking turns.
Players use the symbols X and O to mark their moves on a 3×3 grid.
The program checks for a winner or a draw after every move and displays the result at the end of the game.
After one round finishes, players can choose to play again or exit.

Features

A 3×3 game board displayed in the console.
Two players: one uses X, the other uses O.
Players take turns and enter the row and column numbers to place their symbol.
The game validates the moves, so players cannot choose an occupied cell.
It checks for a winning condition: if any player completes a row, column, or diagonal.
If the board is full and no one wins, the game declares a draw.
After each game, players can decide to play again or quit.

How to Play

The board uses numbers 0, 1, and 2 for rows and columns.
On your turn, type the row and column of your move.
The game shows the updated board after each move.
If someone wins or if the game ends in a draw, the result is displayed.
Players can then decide to play another round or exit the game.
